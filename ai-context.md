# Project Description

Dunkelt is a digital toolset and online platform for the popular tabletop role-playing game Monster Of The Week.

## Key features of Dunkelt include:

Digital character sheets: Users can create and manage their MotW characters online, with automatic calculations for stats, skills, and abilities.
Rules compendium: It provides digital access to official MotW rulebooks and sourcebooks.
Bestiary: A searchable database of creatures and NPCs.
Campaign/Mystery management: Features for organizing and tracking ongoing MotW campaigns.
Homebrew content: Users can create and share custom content like monsters, bystanders, locations, and items.
Digital dice roller: An integrated tool for rolling virtual dice.
Forums and community features: Spaces for MotW players to connect and share ideas.

Dunkelt is for those who prefer digital resources or to play remotely. It's designed to complement traditional tabletop play rather than replace it, offering convenience and enhanced organization for players and Dungeon Masters alike.
