    "description": "A renowned storyteller with an uncanny ability to weave fact and fiction. Andersen is always eager to share tales of the strange and supernatural with anyone who will listen. His stories often contain kernels of truth about local mysteries, hidden behind layers of whimsy and metaphor. He's well-connected in both high society and among the common folk, making him a valuable source of information. However, separating truth from embellishment in his tales can be a challenge. Andersen is particularly fascinated by transformations and curses, and might unknowingly provide crucial clues about such phenomena.",
